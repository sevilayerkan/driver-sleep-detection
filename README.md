# Driver Sleep Detection

## Project Details

ðŸŽ¯ The Driver Sleep Detection App is a web-based application that uses computer vision techniques to track alertness based on eye and mouth movement. It detects closed eyes and yawning in real-time using OpenCV and dlib libraries.

## Features

- Real-time video feed with alertness tracking
- Alert notifications for closed eyes and yawning

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam connected to the system

## Installation

Make sure Python and pip is installed by using this commands in your command line

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

If they are installed use this to install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the shape predictor model:

- Download the shape predictor model (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) from this link: shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.
- Extract the downloaded file.
- Copy the [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/raw/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) file and paste it into the project directory.


## Usage for Flask Web App

### Requirements
